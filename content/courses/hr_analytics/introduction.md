In this section, I'll provide an overview on Python.

<!-- find better place to put this: The goal of this section is to use Python to get high level descriptive or summary statistics in HR Analytic related projects. -->

## Programming

- Process of designing and building a computer program to accomplish something like:
- Analyzing data
- Generating algorithms
- Implementing rules and validations
- And much more!

## Python

- Python is a programming language
- Written by Guido van Rossum in the 1990s
- Great for beginners
- Utilized in many different professions

Facts:
over 8 million users of python by end of 2018
most on demand language to learn - will be powerful to have in your analytics tool belt
lots of value in data science and analytics - helps do heavy lifting for machine learning algorithms
very 'readable' because the syntax was designed to  remove unecessary codes and manage
very popular because it is free and open source - anyone can use it

where to get started? best way to start learning is to dive right in
watch videos, find a project, use stack overflow for help, etc.


## Libraries

- Programming languages have libraries
  - Libraries act as a collection of code that has been stored together in one single file
  - Using a designated code 'unlocks' your access to that library 
  - You can’t simply install Python and start writing commands. You will need to do your research on which “libraries” you need for your analysis. In this class, we will mostly be using Pandas.
