In this section, I'll provide an overview on Python.

<!-- find better place to put this: The goal of this section is to use Python to get high level descriptive or summary statistics in HR Analytic related projects. -->

## Programming

- Process of designing and building a computer program to accomplish something like:
- Analyzing data
- Generating algorithms
- Implementing rules and validations
- And much more!

## Python

- Python is a programming language
- Written by Guido van Rossum in the 1990s
- Great for beginners
- Utilized in many different professions

## Libraries

- Programming languages have libraries
  - Libraries act as a collection of code that has been stored together in one single file
  - Using a designated code 'unlocks' your access to that library 
  - You can’t simply install Python and start writing commands. You will need to do your research on which “libraries” you need for your analysis. In this class, we will mostly be using Pandas.


### Pandas Library

Pandas is a data analysis tool that makes it easy to work with large data sets and do basic, intermediate, and advanced level manipulations. It's a tool used widely by data analysts and data scientists to perform operations commonly done in Excel or SPSS. Pandas operates in a rows-to-columns fashion (2D dataset) which is called a "dataframe". Think of a Google spreadsheet, SPSS file, or Excel workbook.

### NumPy Library

NumPy supports processing large sets of data as well as complex mathematical functions.
